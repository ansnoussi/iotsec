WHAT IS SHODAN: 

SHODAN (http://www.shodanhq.com/) is a
computer search engine designed by web
developer John Matherly
(http://twitter.com/achillean)

While SHODAN is a search engine, it is
much different than content search
engines like Google, Yahoo or Bing


Typical search engines crawl for data on
web pages and then index it for searching

SHODAN interrogates ports and grabs the
resulting banners, then indexes the
banners (rather than the web content) for
searching

Rather than to locate specific content on a
particular search term, SHODAN is
designed to help the user find specific
nodes (desktops, servers, routers,
switches, etc.) with specific content in their
banners

Optimizing search results requires some
basic knowledge of banners






BASIC OPERATIONS:
filters :
country: filters results by two letter country code
hostname: filters results by specified text in the
hostname or domain
net: filter results by a specific IP range or subnet
os: search for specific operating systems
port: narrow the search for specific services


apache country:"TN"
nginx country:"TN"


Popular searches are found in the main page

shodan maps




CONSLUSION:
SHODAN aggregates a significant amount
of information that isn‟t already widely
available in an easy to understand format











CASE STUDY : 
"default password"
The „default password‟ search locates
servers that have those words in the
banner
